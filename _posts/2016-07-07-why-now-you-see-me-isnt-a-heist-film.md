This is one of those things that I felt I wanted to revisit, now that _Now You See Me 2_ is close to completing its theatrical run.

It's simple, really. Also known as a [Caper Story][0], a heist does a couple of things:

The villains are the protagonists.

There's an elaborate, often farcical series of misdirections and plot complications.

Almost every character will be overcompensating in one fashion or another, too smart, strong, wealthy, pretty, witty, _whatever_.

And this one is important: **the film is fair to the viewer**.

## What do I mean by fair?

Well, it's in the sense that the cinematography is presented directly to the audience. Like a good mystery, the clues are there to those paying attention. Although television series, _Leverage_, and _Hustle_ do it. _The Real McCoy_ and _Ocean's Eleven_ (not to be confused with _Ocean's 11_) also try to do that, although they both cheat a little more.

Remember the scene where Danny is interviewing Linus, and the camera's on the table with the tickets, then pans up to Linus's face --- to be quickly interrupted by the sharp pan down showing the tickets are gone? That was done because they couldn't film the lift.

A few times, it doesn't strain credulity, our contract is maintained.

_Now You See Me_ doesn't do that.

Most of the scenes are cut, and the tricks aren't shown. Not only are the cops guessing, but so is the audience.

Just remember that, while you're watching the sequel.
